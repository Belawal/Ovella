Ovella
In this site I aim to introduce new juice product from OrashFoods called Ovella, to the market. The customers will get a chance to see different variants of Ovella i.e. Mango Flavour, Apple Flavour and many more to come. Alone with few other products down the line. 
We will also be able to collect feedback from the customer of which flavour is most appealing to them in return offering them one sample.

My website contains several features:

•	Navigation Bar (drop down functionality)
•	Social media Icon (active social media icon with working links)

Credits 
My main inspiration for the site was from the lesson from Code Academny Love Running Project 
I found their site was very neat and simple and easy as in user friendly with brilliant color scheme , so I used that as my motivation.

As for the contents , that was given by the authroised person from the Orash Foods ltd, permission for me to use their name / brands and any media online for this specific project. 

With this I conclude my ReadME.
