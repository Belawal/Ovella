In this site I aim to introduce new juice product from OrashFoods called
Ovella, to the market. The customers will get a chance to see different
variants of Ovella i.e. Mango Flavour, Apple Flavour and many more to
come. Alone with few other products down the line.

We will also be able to collect feedback from the customer of which
flavour is most appealing to them in return offering them one sample.

My website contains several features:

# Navigation Bar (drop down functionality)

# Social media Icon (active social media icon with working links)

Credits

My main inspiration for the site was from the lesson from Code Academny
Love Running Project

I found their site was very neat and simple and easy as in user friendly
with brilliant color scheme , so I used that as my motivation.

As for the contents , that was given by the authroised person from the
Orash Foods ltd, permission for me to use their name / brands and any
media online for this specific project.

With this I conclude my ReadME.
